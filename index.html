		<p>Environmental pollution refers to the presence of harmful and poisonous substances into our environment. It is not only limited to air pollution but can also affect water bodies, soil, forests, aquatic life and all the land living species as well. The main factors leading to environmental pollution are human generated.Dhaka is the most polluted division while Sylhet is the least polluted. From 2018 to 2021, Dhaka was ranked as the second most polluted city in the world. The western regions (Khulna and Rajshahi) are more polluted than the eastern ones (Sylhet and Chattogram).<br><br>Pollution has tremendous adverse affects on environment, resulting in its degradation and also in depletion of living species. It has severe aftereffects like acid rain, global warming, famine, draught and extreme climatic conditions along with other consequences. The most common type of pollution is air pollution.<mark> The air we breathe today in metropolis or cities is choked with toxic CO (Carbon Monoxide, CO2 (Carbon di- oxide), N2O (Nitrous Oxide) and CH4 (Methane).Inhalation of these gases not only leads to respiratory ailments in humans but also CO2 is a potent green house gas leading to escalated green house effect and global warming.</mark>Transportation industry causes 25% of the global green house gas emission; subsequently, resulting in green house effect and a raised earth’s average surface temperature. Earth’s average surface temperature is constantly rising and is estimated to rise by around <u>1.8</u> by the end of present century. Even the temperature of oceans is on rise, though at a slower rate owing to the ocean’s larger heat absorbing capacity.</p>
